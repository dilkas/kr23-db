\begin{abstract}
  First-order model counting (FOMC) is a computational problem that asks to
  count the models of a sentence in first-order logic. Despite being around for
  more than a decade, practical FOMC algorithms are still unable to compute
  functions as simple as a factorial. We argue that the capabilities of FOMC
  algorithms are severely limited by their inability to express arbitrary
  recursive computations. To enable arbitrary recursion, we relax the
  restrictions that typically accompany domain recursion and generalise circuits
  used to express a solution to an FOMC problem to graphs that may contain
  cycles. To this end, we enhance the most well-established (weighted) FOMC
  algorithm \textsc{ForcLift} with new compilation rules and an algorithm to
  check whether a recursive call is feasible. These improvements allow us to
  find efficient solutions to counting fundamental structures such as injections
  and bijections.

\section{Introduction}

% 1. What is the problem?
% 2. Why is it interesting and important?

\emph{First-order model counting} (FOMC) is the problem of computing the number
of models of a sentence in first-order logic (FOL) given the size(s) of its
domain(s) \citep{DBLP:conf/pods/BeameBGS15}. \emph{Symmetric weighted FOMC}
(WFOMC) extends FOMC with (pairs of) weights on predicates and asks for a
weighted sum across all models instead. By fixing the sizes of the domains, a
WFOMC instance can be rewritten as a WMC instance---in fact, the WFOMC algorithm
by \citet{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11} can do so when it is unable to solve the
instance in a lifted manner. WFOMC emerged as the dominant approach to
\emph{lifted (probabilistic) inference}. Lifted inference techniques exploit
symmetries in probabilistic models by reasoning about sets rather than
individuals \citep{DBLP:conf/ecai/Kersting12}. By doing so, many instances
become solvable in polynomial time \citep{DBLP:conf/nips/Broeck11}. Lifted
inference algorithms are typically used on probabilistic models such as
probabilistic programming languages
\citep{DBLP:journals/ml/RaedtK15,DBLP:journals/ijar/RiguzziBZCL17}, Markov logic
networks
\citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11,DBLP:journals/cacm/GogateD16,DBLP:journals/ml/RichardsonD06},
and other lifted graphical \citep{DBLP:journals/ml/KimmigMG15} and statistical
relational \citep{DBLP:series/synthesis/2016Raedt} models. Lifted inference
techniques for probabilistic databases, while developed somewhat independently,
have also been inspired by WFOMC
\citep{DBLP:journals/pvldb/GatterbauerS15,DBLP:journals/debu/GribkoffSB14}.

% 3. Why is it hard? (E.g., why do naive approaches fail?)
% complexity/liftability -> murky boundary

Traditionally in computational complexity theory, a problem is \emph{tractable}
if it can be solved in time polynomial in the size of the instance. The
equivalent notion in (W)FOMC is liftability. A (W)FOMC instance is
\emph{(domain-)liftable} if it can be solved in time polynomial in the size(s)
of the domain(s) \citep{jaeger2012liftability}. Over more than a decade, more
and more classes of instances were shown to be liftable
\citep{DBLP:conf/kr/BremenK21,DBLP:conf/nips/KazemiKBP16,DBLP:conf/lics/KuusistoL18,DBLP:journals/jair/Kuzelka21}.
First, \citet{DBLP:conf/nips/Broeck11} showed that the class of all sentences of
FOL with up to two variables (denoted \FOtwo{}) is liftable. Then
\citet{DBLP:conf/pods/BeameBGS15} proved that there exists a sentence with three
variables for which FOMC is $\#\P_{1}$-complete (i.e., \FOthree{} is not
liftable). Since these two results came out, most of the research on (W)FOMC
focused on developing faster solutions for the \FOtwo{} fragment
\citep{DBLP:conf/uai/BremenK21,DBLP:conf/aaai/MalhotraS22} and defining
new liftable fragments. These fragments include \SFO{} and \SRU{}
\citep{DBLP:conf/nips/KazemiKBP16}, \Uone{} \citep{DBLP:conf/lics/KuusistoL18},
\FOtwo{} with tree axioms \citep{DBLP:conf/kr/BremenK21}, and \Ctwo{} (i.e., the
two variable fragment with counting quantifiers)
\citep{DBLP:journals/jair/Kuzelka21,DBLP:conf/aaai/MalhotraS22}. On the
empirical front, there are several open-source implementations of exact WFOMC
algorithms: \textsc{ForcLift} \citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11},
probabilistic theorem proving \citep{DBLP:journals/cacm/GogateD16}, and
\textsc{L2C} \citep{DBLP:conf/kr/KazemiP16}. Approximate counting is supported
by \textsc{ApproxWFOMC} \citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BremenK20} as well as
\textsc{ForcLift} \citep{DBLP:conf/uai/BroeckCD12} and probabilistic theorem
proving \citep{DBLP:journals/cacm/GogateD16}.

% 4. Why hasn't it been solved before? (Or, what's wrong with previous proposed
% solutions? How does mine differ?)
% simple unliftable instances -> recursion

However, none of the publicly available exact (W)FOMC algorithms can efficiently
compute functions as simple as a factorial.\footnote{The problem of computing
  the factorial can be described using two variables and counting quantifiers,
  so it is known to be liftable in principle
  \citep{DBLP:journals/jair/Kuzelka21}.} We claim that this shortcoming is due
to the inability of these algorithms to construct recursive solutions. The topic
of recursion in the context of WFOMC has been studied before but in limited
ways. \Citet{DBLP:conf/ilp/BarvinekB0ZK21} use WFOMC to generate numerical data
which is then used to conjecture recurrence relations that explain that data.
\Citet{DBLP:conf/nips/Broeck11} introduced the idea of \emph{domain recursion}.
Intuitively, domain recursion partitions a domain of size $n$ into a single
explicitly named constant and the remaining domain of size $n-1$. However, many
stringent conditions are enforced to ensure that the search for a tractable
solution always terminates.

% 5. What are the key components of my approach and results? Also include any
% specific limitations.

% 5.1) An overview of how ForcLift/Crane work.

In this work, we show how to relax these restrictions in a way that results in a
stronger (W)FOMC algorithm, capable of handling more instances (e.g., counting
various injective mappings) in a lifted manner. The ideas presented in this
paper are implemented in \textsc{Crane}---an extension of the arguably most
well-known WFOMC algorithm \textsc{ForcLift} written in Scala. \textsc{ForcLift}
works in two stages: compilation and evaluation/propagation.\footnote{There is
  also an intermediate stage called \emph{smoothing} that takes place between
  compilation and evaluation. As our changes to smoothing are quite elementary,
  we do not discuss them to not distract the reader from the main contributions
  of this paper.} In the first part, various \emph{(compilation) rules} are
applied to the input (or some derivative) formula, gradually constructing a
circuit. In the second part, the weights of the instance (and sometimes
constants) are propagated through the circuit, computing the WMC\@.

% 5.2) The main idea: cycles that represent recursive calls.

The main conceptual difference between \textsc{Crane} and \textsc{ForcLift} is
that we utilise labelled directed graphs instead of circuits. The cycles in
these graphs represent recursive calls. Suppose the input formula $\phi$ depends
on a domain of size $n \in \mathbb{N}$. \emph{Generalised domain recursion}
(GDR), one of the new compilation rules, transforms $\phi$ into a different
formula $\psi$ that has an additional constant and some new \emph{constraints}.
After some additional transformations, the constraints in $\psi$ become
`uniform' and can be removed, replacing the domain of size $n$ with a new domain
of size $n-1$---this is the responsibility of the \emph{constraint removal} (CR)
compilation rule. Afterwards, another new compilation rule recognizes that the
resulting formula $\phi(n-1)$ is just like the input formula $\phi(n)$ except it
refers to a different domain. This observation allows us to add a cycle-forming
edge to the graph, which can be interpreted as function $f$ relying on $f(n-1)$
to compute $f(n)$.

% 5.3) contributions, references to sections, shortcomings

We begin by defining the representation used for sentences in FOL in
\cref{sec:recprelims}. Then, in \cref{sec:methods}, we define the graphs that
replace circuits in representing a solution to a (W)FOMC problem.
\Cref{sec:rules} introduces the new compilation rules. In \cref{sec:interpret},
we discuss how a graph can be interpreted as a collection of (potentially
recursive) functions. In \cref{sec:results}, we compare \textsc{ForcLift} and
\textsc{Crane} on a range of function-counting problems. We show that
\textsc{Crane} performs as well as \textsc{ForcLift} on the instances that were
already solvable by \textsc{ForcLift} but is also able to handle most of the
instances that \textsc{ForcLift} fails on. Finally, in \cref{sec:conclusion}, we
conclude by outlining some conjectures and directions for future work.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:recprelims}

Our representation of FOMC instances is largely based on the format used
internally by \textsc{ForcLift}, some aspects of which are described by
\citet{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11}. \textsc{ForcLift} is able to translate
sentences in a variant of function-free many-sorted FOL with equality to this
internal format. An \emph{atom} is $p(t_1, \dots, t_n)$ for some predicate $p$
and terms $t_{1}, \dots, t_{n}$. Here, $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$ is the \emph{arity}
of $p$. A \emph{term} is either a constant or a variable. A \emph{literal} is
either an atom or the negation of an atom (denoted by
$\neg p(t_1, \dots, t_n)$). Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the set of all domains.
Initially, $\mathcal{D}$ contains all domains mentioned by the input (W)FOMC
instance. During compilation, new domains added to $\mathcal{D}$ by some of the
compilation rules.

\begin{definition}[Constraint]\label{def:constraint}
  An \emph{(inequality) constraint} is a pair $(a, b)$, where $a$ is a variable,
  and $b$ is either a variable or a constant.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Clause]\label{def:clause}
  A \emph{clause}\footnote{\citet{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11} refer to clauses
    as c-clauses.} is a triple $c = (L, C, \delta_c)$, where $L$ is a set of
  literals, $C$ is a set of constraints, and $\delta_c$ is the domain map of
  $c$. Let $\Vars$ be the function that maps clauses and sets of either literals
  or constraints to the set of variables contained within. In particular,
  $\Vars(c) \coloneqq \Vars(L) \cup \Vars(C)$. \emph{Domain map}
  $\delta_{c}\colon \Vars(c) \to \mathcal{D}$ is a function that maps all
  variables in $c$ to their domains such that (s.t.) if $(X, Y) \in C$ for some
  variables $X$ and $Y$, then $\delta_c(X) = \delta_c(Y)$. For convenience, we
  sometimes write $\delta_c$ for the domain map of $c$ without unpacking $c$
  into its three constituents.
\end{definition}

Similarly to variables in \cref{def:clause}, all constants are (implicitly)
mapped to domains, and each $n$-ary predicate is implicitly mapped to a sequence
of $n$ domains. For constant or variable $x$, predicate $p$, and domains
$\Gamma$ and $\Delta$, we write, e.g., $x \in \Gamma$ and
$p \in \Gamma \times \Delta$ to denote that $x$ is associated with $\Gamma$, and
$p$ is associated with $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ (in that order).

\begin{definition}[Formula]\label{def:formula}
  A \emph{formula} (called a c-theory by \citet{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11})
  is a set of clauses s.t.\ all constraints and atoms `type check' with respect
  to domains.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}\label{example:first}
  Let $\phi \coloneqq \{\, c_1, c_2 \,\}$ be a formula with clauses
  \begin{align*}
    c_1 &\coloneqq
          \begin{multlined}[t]
            (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(X, Z) \,\}, \{\, (Y, Z) \,\}, \\
            \{\, X \mapsto \Gamma, Y \mapsto \Delta, Z \mapsto \Delta \,\}),
          \end{multlined}\\
    c_2 &\coloneqq
          \begin{multlined}[t]
            (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(Z, Y) \,\}, \{\, (X, Z) \,\}, \\
            \{\, X \mapsto \Gamma, Y \mapsto \Delta, Z \mapsto \Gamma \,\})
          \end{multlined}
  \end{align*}
  for some predicate $p$, variables $X$, $Y$, $Z$, and domains $\Gamma$ and
  $\Delta$. Then $\Vars(\{\, (Y, Z) \,\}) = \{\, Y, Z \,\}$, and
  $\Vars(c_{1}) = \Vars(c_{2}) = \{\, X, Y, Z \,\}$. Based on the domain maps of
  $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, we can infer that $p \in \Gamma \times \Delta$. All
  variables (in both clauses) that occur as the first argument to $p$ are in
  $\Gamma$, and likewise all variables that occur as the second argument to $p$
  are in $\Delta$. Therefore, $\phi$ `type checks' as a valid formula.
\end{example}

There are two major differences between
\cref{def:constraint,def:clause,def:formula} and the corresponding concepts
introduced by \citet{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11}. First, we decouple
variable-to-domain assignments from constraints and move them to a separate
function $\delta_{c}$ in \cref{def:clause}. Formalising these assignments as a
function unveils the (previously implicit) assumption that each variable must be
assigned to a domain. Second, while \citet{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11} allow
for equality constraints and constraints of the form $X \not\in \Delta$ for some
variable $X$ and domain $\Delta$, we exclude such constraints simply because
they are not needed.

One can read a formula as in \cref{def:formula} as a sentence in a FOL\@. All
variables in a clause are implicitly universally quantified (but note that
variables are never shared among clauses), and all clauses in a formula are
implicitly linked by conjunction. Thus, formula $\phi$ from \cref{example:first}
reads as
\begin{align*}
  &\begin{multlined}[t]
    (\forall X \in \Gamma\text{. }\forall Y, Z \in \Delta\text{. }\\
    Y \ne Z \implies \neg p(X, Y) \lor \neg p(X, Z)) \land
    \end{multlined}\\
  &\begin{multlined}[t]
    (\forall X, Z \in \Gamma\text{. }\forall Y \in \Delta\text{. }\\
    X \ne Z \implies \neg p(X, Y) \lor \neg p(Z, Y)).
    \end{multlined}
\end{align*}

Once domains are mapped to finite sets and constants to specific (and different)
elements in those sets, a formula can be viewed as a set of conditions that the
predicates (interpreted as relations) have to satisfy.\footnote{If some domain
  is not big enough to contain all of its constants, the formula is
  unsatisfiable.} Hence, FOMC is the problem of counting the number of
combinations of relations that satisfy these conditions.

\begin{example}
  Let $\phi$ be as in \cref{example:first} and let $|\Gamma| = |\Delta| = 2$.
  There are $2^{2 \times 2} = 16$ possible relations between $\Gamma$ and
  $\Delta$. Let us count how many of them satisfy the conditions imposed on
  predicate $p$. The empty relation does. All four relations of cardinality one
  do too. Finally, there are two relations of cardinality two that satisfy the
  conditions as well. Thus, the FOMC of $\phi$ (when $|\Gamma| = |\Delta| = 2$)
  is 7. Incidentally, the FOMC of $\phi$ counts partial injections. We will
  continue to use the problem of counting partial injections (and the formula
  from \cref{example:first} specifically) as the main running example throughout
  the paper.
\end{example}

\paragraph*{Notation.}
We write $\langle\rangle$ and $\langle x \rangle$ to denote an empty list and a
list with one element $x$, respectively, and $|l|$ to denote the length of list
$l$. We write $\pfun$ for partial functions. Let $S$ be a set of constraints or
literals, $V$ a set of variables, and $x$ either a variable or a constant. We
write $S[x/V]$ to denote $S$ with all occurrences of all variables in $V$
replaced with $x$.\footnote{Note that if $(X, Y)$ is a two-variable constraint,
  substituting a constant $c$ for $X$ would result in $(c, Y)$, which would have
  to be rewritten as $(Y, c)$ to fit the definition of a constraint.}

% From circuits to graphs.
A \emph{first-order deterministic decomposable negation normal form
  computational graph} (FCG) is a (weakly connected) directed graph with a
single source, node labels, and ordered outgoing edges.\footnote{Note that
  imposing an ordering on outgoing edges is just a limited version of edge
  labelling.} Node labels consist of two parts: the \emph{type} and the
\emph{parameters}. The out-degree of each node is determined by its type.
Similarly to \citet{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11}, we write $T_p$ for an FCG
that has a node with label $T_p$ (i.e., type $T$ and parameter(s) $p$) and
$\star$'s as all of its direct successors.

Most of the types are as in previous work
\citep{DBLP:conf/nips/Broeck11,DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11}. The type for
non-tree-like edges (denoted by $\Reff$), while used before, is extended to
contain the information necessary to support recursive calls. We also add three
new types:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a type for constraint removal denoted by $\CR$,
  \item a type for generalised domain recursion denoted by $\GDR$ (both with
        out-degree one),
  \item and $\star$---a placeholder type (with out-degree zero) for nodes that
        are going to be replaced.
\end{itemize}
When drawing an FCG, we order outgoing edges from left to right, write node
labels directly on the nodes, and omit irrelevant labels and/or parameters. See
\cref{fig:examplefcg} for an example FCG\@. Its source node has out-degree 1,
label $\GDR_{\Gamma \gets \Gamma \setminus \{\, x \,\}}$, and type $\GDR$.

% Connecting FCGs with formulas
Finally, we introduce a structure that represents a solution to a (W)FOMC
problem while it is still being built. A \emph{chip} is a pair $(G, L)$, where
$G$ is an FCG, and $L$ is a list of formulas, s.t. $|L|$ is equal to the number
of $\star$'s in $G$. The intuition behind this definition is that $L$ contains
formulas that still need to be compiled. Once a formula is compiled, it replaced
one of the $\star$'s in $G$ according to a set order. We say that an FCG is
\emph{complete} (i.e., it represents a \emph{complete solution}) if it has no
$\star$'s. Similarly, a chip is complete if its FCG is complete (or,
equivalently, the list of formulas is empty).

\section{New Compilation Rules}\label{sec:rules}

A \emph{(compilation) rule} takes a formula and returns a set of chips. The
cardinality of this set is the number of different ways in which the rule can be
applied to the input formula. While \textsc{ForcLift}
\citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11} heuristically chooses one of them, in an
attempt to not miss a solution, \textsc{Crane} returns them all. In particular,
if a rule returns an empty set, then that rule is not applicable to the formula,
and the algorithm continues with the next rule.

\subsection{Generalised Domain Recursion}\label{sec:dr}

% Main idea
The main idea behind domain recursion (both the original version by
\citet{DBLP:conf/nips/Broeck11} and the one presented here) is as follows. Let
$\Omega \in \mathcal{D}$ be a domain. Assuming that $\Omega \ne \emptyset$, pick
some $x \in \Omega$. Then, for every variable $X \in \Omega$ that occurs in a
literal, consider two possibilities: $X = x$ and $X \ne x$.

\begin{example}\label{example:dr}
  Let $\phi$ be a formula with a single clause
  \begin{multline*}
    (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(X, Z) \,\}, \{\, (Y, Z) \,\}, \\
    \{\, X \mapsto \Gamma, Y \mapsto \Delta, Z \mapsto \Delta \,\}).
  \end{multline*}
  Then we can introduce constant $x \in \Gamma$ and rewrite $\phi$ as
  $\phi' = \{\, c_{1}, c_{2} \,\}$, where
  \begin{align*}
    c_{1} &= \begin{multlined}[t]
      (\{\, \neg p(x, Y), \neg p(x, Z) \,\}, \{\, (Y, Z) \,\}, \\
      \{\, Y \mapsto \Delta, Z \mapsto \Delta \,\}),
      \end{multlined}\\
    c_{2} &= \begin{multlined}[t]
      (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(X, Z) \,\}, \{\, (X, x), (Y, Z) \,\}, \\
      \{\, X \mapsto \Gamma', Y \mapsto \Delta, Z \mapsto \Delta \,\}),
      \end{multlined}
  \end{align*}
    and $\Gamma' = \Gamma \setminus \{\, x \,\}$.
\end{example}

% Original domain recursion
\citet{DBLP:conf/nips/Broeck11} imposes stringent preconditions on the input
formula to ensure that the expanded version of the formula (as in
\cref{example:dr}) can be handled efficiently. The clauses in this expanded
formula are then partitioned into three parts based on whether the
transformation introduced constants or constraints or both. The aforementioned
conditions ensure that these parts can be treated independently.

  }
\end{algorithm}

% Description of GDR, in contrast to DR
In contrast, GDR has only one precondition: for GDR to be applicable on domain
$\Omega \in \mathcal{D}$, there must be at least one variable with domain
$\Omega$ that is featured in a literal (and not just in constraints). Without
such variables, GDR would have no effect on the formula. GDR is also simpler in
that the expanded formula is left as-is to be handled by other compilation
rules. Typically, after a few more rules are applied, a combination of $\CR$ and
$\Reff$ nodes introduces a loop back to the $\GDR$ node, thus completing the
definition of a recursive function. The GDR compilation rule is summarised as
\cref{alg:domainrecursion} and explained in more detail using the example below.

\begin{example}
  Let $\phi \coloneqq \{\, c_1, c_2 \,\}$ be the formula from
  \cref{example:first}. While GDR is possible on both domains, here we
  illustrate how it works on $\Gamma$. Having chosen a domain, the algorithm
  iterates over the clauses of $\phi$. Suppose \cref{line:forclause} picks
  $c = c_1$ as the first clause. Then, set $V$ is constructed to contain all
  variables with domain $\Omega = \Gamma$ that occur in the literals of clause
  $c$. In this case, $V = \{\, X \,\}$.

  \Cref{line:conditions} iterates over all subsets $W \subseteq V$ of variables
  that can be replaced by a constant without resulting in formulas that are
  evidently unsatisfiable. We impose two restrictions on $W$. First,
  $W^2 \cap C = \emptyset$ ensures that there are no pairs of variables in $W$
  that are constrained to be distinct, since that would result in a $x \ne x$
  constraint after substitution. Similarly, we want to avoid variables in $W$
  that have inequality constraints with constants: after substitution, such
  constraints would transform into inequality constraints between two constants.
  In this case, both subsets of $V$ satisfy these conditions, and
  \cref{line:generation} generates two clauses for the output formula:
  \begin{multline*}
    (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(X, Z) \,\}, \{\, (Y, Z), (X, x) \,\}, \\
    \{\, X \mapsto \Gamma, Y \mapsto \Delta, Z \mapsto \Delta \,\}),
  \end{multline*}
  from $W = \emptyset$ and
  \[
    (\{\, \neg p(x, Y), \neg p(x, Z) \,\}, \{\, (Y, Z) \,\}, \{\, Y \mapsto \Delta, Z \mapsto \Delta \,\})
  \]
  from $W = V$.

  When \cref{line:forclause} picks $c = c_2$, then $V = \{\, X, Z \,\}$. The
  subset $W = V$ fails to satisfy the conditions on \cref{line:conditions}
  because of the $X \ne Z$ constraint. The other three subsets of $V$ all
  generate clauses for $\phi'$. Indeed, $W = \emptyset$ generates
  \begin{multline*}
    (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(Z, Y) \,\}, \{\, (X, Z), (X, x), (Z, x) \,\}, \\
    \{\, X \mapsto \Gamma, Y \mapsto \Delta, Z \mapsto \Gamma \,\}),
  \end{multline*}
  $W = \{\, X \,\}$ generates
  \[
    (\{\, \neg p(x, Y), \neg p(Z, Y) \,\}, \{\, (Z, x) \,\}, \{\, Y \mapsto \Delta, Z \mapsto \Gamma \,\}),
  \]
  and $W = \{\, Z \,\}$ generates
  \[
    (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(x, Y) \,\}, \{\, (X, x) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto \Gamma, Y \mapsto \Delta \,\}).
  \]
\end{example}

\subsection{Constraint Removal}\label{sec:cr}

\begin{algorithm}[t]
  \caption{The compilation rule for $\CR$ nodes.}\label{alg:constraintremoval}
  \KwIn{formula $\phi$, set of all relevant domains $\mathcal{D}$}
  \KwOut{set of chips $S$}

    add a new domain $\Omega'$ to $\mathcal{D}$\;
    $\phi' \gets \emptyset$\;
    \ForEach{clause $(L, C, \delta) \in \phi$}{
      $C' \gets \{\, (a, b) \in C \mid b \ne x \,\}$\;\label{line:constraintremoval}
      \nosemic$\delta' \gets X \mapsto
      \begin{cases}
        \Omega' & \text{if } \delta(X) = \Omega\\
        \delta(X) & \text{otherwise;}
      \end{cases}$\;\label{line:newdelta}
      $\phi' \gets \phi' \cup \{\, (L, C', \delta') \,\}$\;
    }
    $S \gets S \cup \{\, (\CR_{\Omega \mapsto \Omega'}, \langle\phi'\rangle) \,\}$\;
  }
\end{algorithm}

Recall that GDR on a domain $\Omega$ creates constraints of the form $X_i \ne x$
for some constant $x \in \Omega$ and family of variables $X_i \in \Omega$. Once
certain conditions are satisfied, \cref{alg:constraintremoval} can eliminate
these constraints and replace $\Omega$ with a new domain $\Omega'$, which can be
interpreted as $\Omega \setminus \{\, x \,\}$. These conditions (on
\cref{line:crconditions} of the algorithm) are that a constraint of the form
$X \ne x$ exists for all variables $X \in \Omega$ across all clauses, and such
constraints are the only place where $x$ occurs. The algorithm then proceeds to
construct the new formula by removing constraints (on
\cref{line:constraintremoval}) and constructing a new domain map $\delta'$ that
replaces $\Omega$ with $\Omega'$ (on \cref{line:newdelta}).

\begin{example}
  Let $\phi = \{\, c_1, c_2, c_3 \,\}$ be a formula with clauses
  \begin{align*}
    c_1 &= (\emptyset, \{\, (Y, X) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto \Delta^\top, Y \mapsto \Delta^\top \,\}), \\
    c_2 &=
          \begin{multlined}[t]
            (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(X, Z) \,\}, \{\, (X, x), (Y, Z) \,\}, \\
            \{\, X \mapsto \Gamma, Y \mapsto \Delta^\bot, Z \mapsto \Delta^\bot \,\}),
          \end{multlined}\\
    c_3 &=
          \begin{multlined}[t]
            (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(Z, Y) \,\}, \\
            \{\, (X, x), (Z, X), (Z, x) \,\}, \\
            \{\, X \mapsto \Gamma, Y \mapsto \Delta^\bot, Z \mapsto \Gamma \,\}).
          \end{multlined}
  \end{align*}
  Domain $\Gamma$ and with its element $x \in \Gamma$ satisfy the preconditions
  for CR\@. The rule introduces a new domain $\Gamma'$ and transforms $\phi$ to
  $\phi' = (c_1', c_2', c_3')$, where
  \begin{align*}
    c_1' &= c_1, \\
    c_2' &=
           \begin{multlined}[t]
             (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(X, Z) \,\}, \{\, (Y, Z) \,\}, \\
             \{\, X \mapsto \Gamma', Y \mapsto \Delta^\bot, Z \mapsto \Delta^\bot \,\}),
           \end{multlined} \\
    c_3' &=
           \begin{multlined}[t]
             (\{\, \neg p(X, Y), \neg p(Z, Y) \,\}, \{\, (Z, X) \,\}, \\
             \{\, X \mapsto \Gamma', Y \mapsto \Delta^\bot, Z \mapsto \Gamma' \,\}).
           \end{multlined}
  \end{align*}
\end{example}

\subsection{Identifying Opportunities for Recursion}\label{sec:ref}

Let $\Doms$ be a function that maps any clause or formula to the set of domains
used within, and let $\dom(f)$ denote the domain of function $f$.

We use (integer-valued) hash functions to efficiently discard pairs of formulas
that are too different for recursion to be established. The hash code of a
clause $c = (L, C, \delta_{c})$ (denoted by $\# c$) combines the hash codes of
the sets of constants and predicates in $c$, the numbers of positive and
negative literals, the number of inequality constraints $|C|$, and the number of
variables $|\Vars(c)|$. The hash code of a formula $\phi$ combines the hash
codes of all its clauses and is denoted by $\#\phi$.

\citet{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11} use a cache to check if a formula is
identical to one of the formulas that have already been fully compiled. In
\textsc{Crane}, to facilitate recursion, we extend the caching scheme to include
formulas that have been encountered but not fully compiled yet. Formally, we
define a \emph{cache} to be a map from integers (e.g., hash codes) to sets of
pairs of the form $(\phi, v)$, where $\phi$ is a formula, and $v$ is an FCG
node.

\begin{algorithm}[t]
  \caption{The compilation rule for $\Reff$ nodes.}\label{alg:trycache}
  \KwIn{formula $\phi$, cache $C$}
  \KwOut{a set of chips}

  \ForEach{formula and node $(\psi, v) \in C(\#\phi)$}{
    $\rho \gets \identifyRecursion{$\phi$, $\psi$}$\;
    \lIf{$\rho \ne {\normalfont \texttt{null}}$}{\Return{$\{\, (\Reff_\rho(v), \langle\rangle) \,\}$}}
  }
  \Return{$\emptyset$}\;

  \Fn{\identifyRecursion{formula $\phi$, formula $\psi$, map $\rho = \emptyset$}}{
    \lIf{$|\phi| \ne |\psi|$ {\bf or} $\#\phi \ne \#\psi$}{\Return{\normalfont\texttt{null}}}
    \lIf{$\phi = \emptyset$}{\Return{$\rho$}}
    \ForEach{clause $c \in \psi$\label{line:for1}}{
      \ForEach{clause $d \in \phi$ s.t. $\#d=\#c$\label{line:for2}}{
        \ForAll{$\gamma \in \generateMaps{$c$, $d$, $\rho$}$\label{line:generateMaps}}{
          $\rho' \gets \identifyRecursion{$\phi\setminus\{\, d \,\}$, $\psi\setminus\{\, c \,\}$, $\rho\cup\gamma$}$\;\label{line:recursion}
          \lIf{$\rho' \ne {\normalfont \texttt{null}}$}{\Return{$\rho'$}}
        }
      }
      \Return{\normalfont\texttt{null}}\;
    }
  }
\end{algorithm}

% Cache $C$ is used to partition all previously-encountered formulas based on
% their hash codes.
\Cref{alg:trycache} describes the compilation rule for creating $\Reff$ nodes.
For every formula $\psi$ in the cache s.t. $\#\psi = \#\phi$, function
\texttt{r} is called to check whether a recursive call is feasible. If it is,
\texttt{r} returns a (total) map $\rho\colon \Doms(\psi) \to \Doms(\phi)$ that
shows how $\psi$ can be transformed into $\phi$ by replacing each domain
$\Omega \in \Doms(\psi)$ with $\rho(\Omega) \in \Doms(\phi)$. Otherwise,
\texttt{r} returns \texttt{null} to signify that $\phi$ and $\psi$ are too
different for recursion to work. This happens if $\phi$ and $\psi$ (or their
subformulas explored in recursive calls) are structurally different (i.e., the
numbers of clauses or the hash codes fail to match) or if a clause of $\psi$
cannot be paired with a sufficiently similar clause of $\phi$. Function
\texttt{r} works by iterating over pairs of clauses of $\phi$ and $\psi$ that
have the same hash codes. For every pair of clauses that are sufficiently
similar, \texttt{r} calls itself on the remaining clauses until the map
$\rho\colon \Doms(\psi) \pfun \Doms(\phi)$ becomes total, and all clauses are
successfully coupled.

The compatibility of two clauses is checked by function \texttt{genMaps}. It
considers every possible bijection $\beta\colon \Vars(c) \to \Vars(d)$ and map
$\gamma\colon \Doms(c) \to \Doms(d)$ s.t.
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \Vars(c) \ar[r, dashed, "\beta"] \arrow[d, swap, "\delta_c"] & \Vars(d) \ar[d, "\delta_d"] \\
    \Doms(c) \ar[r, dashed, "\gamma"] \ar[d, hookrightarrow] & \Doms(d) \ar[d, hookrightarrow] \\
    \Doms(\psi) \ar[r, swap, "\rho", "|" marking, outer sep=5pt] & \Doms(\phi).
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
commutes, and $c$ becomes equal to $d$ when its variables are replaced according
to $\beta$ and its domains replaced according to $\gamma$. The function then
returns each such $\gamma$ as soon as possible. The commutativity check also
ensures that $\rho \cup \gamma$ is possible on \cref{line:recursion} of
\cref{alg:trycache}. The resulting (partial) function $\rho \cup \gamma$ is the
unique function s.t. $\rho \cup \gamma|_{\dom(\rho)} = \rho$, and
$\rho \cup \gamma|_{\dom(\gamma)} = \gamma$. The operation is defined when
$\rho|_{\dom(\rho)\cap\dom(\gamma)} = \gamma|_{\dom(\rho)\cap\dom(\gamma)}$.

\section{How to Interpret an FCG}\label{sec:interpret}

When \textsc{ForcLift} \citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11} compiles a WFOMC
instance into a circuit, each gate type encodes an arithmetic operation on its
inputs and parameters. These operations are then immediately performed while
traversing the circuit and using domain sizes and weights as the initial inputs.
With \textsc{Crane}, the interpretation of an FCG is a collection of functions.
Each function has (some) domain sizes as parameters and may contain recursive
calls to other functions, including itself. While there may be any number of
subsidiary functions, there is always one main function that can be called with
the sizes of the domains of the input formula as arguments. Henceforth, this
function is always called $f$, and it is defined by the source node.

The interpretation of a node is decided by its type. Here we describe the
interpretations of new (or significantly changed) types and refer the reader to
previous work \citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11} for information on other
types. Both $\CR$ and $\GDR$ nodes do not contribute anything to the definitions
of functions---the interpretation of such a node is simply the interpretation of
its only direct successor. Obviously, $\star$ nodes also have no interpretation,
although for a different reason: incomplete FCGs are not meant to be
interpreted. The interpretation of a $\Reff$ node is a function call. The direct
successor of the $\Reff$ node (say, $v$) then must introduce a function. The
parameters of this function are the sizes of all domains used by nodes reachable
from $v$.

\begin{example}\label{example:interpretation}
  Let us use the FCG from \cref{fig:examplefcg} as an example. The input formula
  (i.e., the formula in \cref{example:first}) has two domains: $\Gamma$ and
  $\Delta$. Thus, the interpretation of the FCG is a function
  $f\colon \mathbb{N}_{0} \times \mathbb{N}_{0} \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$. Let
  $m \coloneqq |\Gamma|$, and $n \coloneqq |\Delta|$. The node labelled
  $\bigvee_{\Delta^{\top} \subseteq \Delta}$ tells us that
  $f(m, n) = \sum_{l = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{l} \square$, where $\square$ is the
  interpretation of the remaining subgraph, and $l$ iterates over all possible
  sizes of $\Delta^{\top}$. It also creates two subdomains
  $\Delta^{\top}, \Delta^{\bot} \subseteq b$ that partition $\Delta$, i.e., as
  the size of $\Delta^{\top}$ increases, the size of $\Delta^{\bot}$
  correspondingly decreases. Nodes labelled $\land$ correspond to
  multiplication. Therefore,
  $f(m, n) = \sum_{l = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{l} \diamondsuit \times \heartsuit$,
  where $\diamondsuit$ is the interpretation of the contradiction (i.e., $\bot$)
  node, and $\heartsuit$ is the interpretation of the $\Reff$ node.

  A contradiction node with clause $c$ as a parameter is interpreted as one if
  the clause has groundings and zero otherwise. In this case, the parameter is
  $c = (\emptyset, \{\, (X, Y) \,\}, \{\, X \mapsto \Delta^\top, Y \mapsto \Delta^\top \,\})$
  (not shown in \cref{fig:examplefcg}), which can be read as
  $\forall X, Y \in \Delta^{\top}\text{. }X \ne Y \implies \bot$, i.e.,
  $\forall X, Y \in \Delta^{\top}\text{. }X = Y$. This latter sentence is true
  if and only if $|\Delta^{\top}| < 2$. Therefore, we can use the Iverson
  bracket notation to write
  \[
    \diamondsuit = [l < 2] \coloneqq
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if } l < 2 \\
      0 & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
  \]

  It remains to interpret the $\Reff$ node. Parameter
  $\{\, \Gamma \mapsto \Gamma', \Delta \mapsto \Delta^\bot \,\}$ tells us that
  the interpretation of the $\Reff$ node should be the same as that of the
  source node, but with domains $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ replaced with $\Gamma'$
  and $\Delta^{\bot}$, respectively. Domain $\Gamma'$ was created by the CR rule
  applied on $\Gamma$, so $|\Gamma'| = m - 1$. Now
  $\Delta^{\bot} = \Delta \setminus \Delta^{\top}$, and $|\Delta^{\top}| = l$,
  so $|\Delta^{\bot}| = n - l$. Thus, the interpretation of the $\Reff$ node is
  a recursive call to $f(m - 1, n - l)$. Therefore,
  \begin{align}
    f(m, n) &= \sum_{l = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{l} [l < 2] f(m-1, n-l)\nonumber \\
            &= f(m-1, n) + n f(m-1, n-1).\label{eq:solution}
  \end{align}
  In order to use this recursive function to compute the model count of the
  input formula for any domain sizes, one just needs to find the base cases
  $f(0, n)$ and $f(m, 0)$ for all $m, n \in \mathbb{N}_{0}$.
\end{example}

In this section, we compare \textsc{Crane} and \textsc{ForcLift}
\citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11} on their ability to count various kinds of
functions. (Other WFOMC algorithms such as \textsc{L2C}
\citep{DBLP:conf/kr/KazemiP16} and probabilistic theorem proving
\citep{DBLP:journals/cacm/GogateD16} are unable to solve any of the instances
that \textsc{ForcLift} fails on.) We begin by describing how such functions can
be expressed in FOL\@. \textsc{ForcLift} then translates these sentences in FOL
to formulas as defined in \cref{def:formula}.

% Describe what kind of instances we're investigating
Let $p \in \Gamma \times \Delta$ be a predicate. To restrict all relations
representable by $p$ to just functions from $\Gamma$ to $\Delta$, in FOL one
might write
\[
  \forall X \in \Gamma\text{. }\forall Y, Z \in \Delta\text{. }p(X, Y) \land p(X, Z) \implies Y = Z
\]
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:def2}
  \forall X \in \Gamma\text{. }\exists Y \in \Delta\text{. }p(X, Y).
\end{equation}
The former sentence says that one element of $\Gamma$ can map to at \emph{most}
one element of $\Delta$, and the latter sentence says that each element of
$\Gamma$ must map to at \emph{least} one element of $\Delta$. One can then add
\[
  \forall X,Z \in \Gamma\text{. }\forall Y \in \Delta\text{. }p(X, Y) \land p(Z, Y) \implies X = Z
\]
to restrict $p$ to injections or
\[
  \forall Y \in \Delta\text{. }\exists X \in \Gamma\text{. }p(X, Y)
\]
to ensure surjectivity or remove \cref{eq:def2} to consider partial functions.
Lastly, one can replace all occurrences of $\Delta$ with $\Gamma$ to model
endofunctions (i.e., functions with the same domain and codomain) instead.

% the process: both for running algorithms and for determining complexities
In our experiments, we consider all sixteen combinations of these properties,
i.e., injectivity, surjectivity, partiality, and endo-. \textsc{ForcLift} is
always run until it terminates. \textsc{Crane} is run until either five
solutions are found or the search tree reaches height 6.\footnote{The search
  tree has a high branching factor, so exploring all nodes at depth 5 takes at
  most a few seconds whereas doing the same for depth 6 can be computationally
  infeasible in some cases.} If successful, \textsc{ForcLift} generates a
circuit, and \textsc{Crane} generates one or more (complete) FCGs. In both
cases, we manually convert the resulting graphs into definitions of functions as
described in \cref{sec:interpret}. We then assess the complexity of each
solution and pick the best if \textsc{Crane} returns several solutions of
varying complexities. When assessing the complexity of each such definition, we
make two assumptions. First, we can compute the binomial coefficient
$\binom{n}{k}$ in $\Theta(nk)$ time. Second, techniques such as dynamic
programming and memoization are used to avoid recomputing the same binomial
coefficient or function call multiple times.

The experimental results are summarised in \cref{tbl:results}. The best-known
asymptotic complexity for computing total surjections is by \citet{30049}. All
other best-known complexity results are inferred from the formulas and programs
on the on-line encyclopedia of integer sequences \citep{oeis}. On instances that
could already be solved by \textsc{ForcLift}, the two algorithms perform equally
well. However, \textsc{Crane} is also able to solve all but one instances that
\textsc{ForcLift} fails on in at most cubic time.

Let us examine the case of counting partial (non-endomorphic) injections more
closely. The FCG in \cref{fig:examplefcg,example:interpretation} counts partial
injections and is responsible for the $mn$ entry in the table. For a complete
solution, \cref{eq:solution} must be combined with the base case $f(0, n) = 1$
for all $n \in \mathbb{N}_{0}$. In other words, the base case says that the
empty partial map is the only partial injection with an empty domain, regardless
of the codomain. Finally, note that $f(m, n)$ can be evaluated in $\Theta(mn)$
time by a dynamic programming algorithm that computes $f(i, j)$ for all
$i = 0, \dots, m$ and $j = 0, \dots, n$.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

% A summary of what's been done/achieved and how

In this paper, we showed how a state-of-the-art (W)FOMC algorithm can be
empowered by generalising domain recursion and adding support for cycles in the
graph that encodes a solution. To construct such graphs, \textsc{Crane}
supplements \textsc{ForcLift} \citep{DBLP:conf/ijcai/BroeckTMDR11} with three
new compilation rules. The experiments in \cref{sec:results} revealed a range of
counting problems that are liftable to \textsc{Crane} but not to any other
(W)FOMC algorithm. Although here we focused on FOMC problems,
\textsc{ForcLift}'s support for weights trivially transfers to \textsc{Crane} as
well. The common thread across these newly liftable problems is (partial)
injectivity. Thus, we can formulate the following conjecture.

\begin{conjecture}
  Let \IFO{} be the class of formulas in FOL that contain clauses with at most
  two variables as well as any number of copies
  \begin{align*}
    &\begin{multlined}[t]
      (\forall X \in \Gamma\text{. }\forall Y, Z \in \Delta\text{. }\\
      Y \ne Z \implies \neg p(X, Y) \lor \neg p(X, Z)) \land
    \end{multlined}\\
    &\begin{multlined}[t]
      (\forall X, Z \in \Gamma\text{. }\forall Y \in \Delta\text{. }\\
      X \ne Z \implies \neg p(X, Y) \lor \neg p(Z, Y)).
    \end{multlined}
  \end{align*}
  for some predicate $p$ and domains $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$. Then \IFO{} is
  liftable by \textsc{Crane}.
\end{conjecture}

Since the tasks of counting injections and bijections fall into the \Ctwo{}
fragment as well, we can formulate an even stronger conjecture.

\begin{conjecture}
  \Ctwo{} is liftable by \textsc{Crane} by either reformulating formulas in
  \Ctwo{} to avoid counting quantifiers or extending \textsc{Crane} to support
  them.
\end{conjecture}

However, the most important direction for future work is in fully automating
this new way of computing the (W)FOMC of a formula. First, we need an algorithm
that transforms FCGs into definitions of functions. Formalising this process
would also allow us to prove the correctness of the new compilation rules in
constructing FCGs that indeed compute the right WMC\@. Second, these definitions
must be simplified before they can be used, perhaps by a computer algebra
system. Third, most importantly, we need a way to find the base cases for the
recursive definitions provided by \textsc{Crane}. Fourth, since the first
solution found by \textsc{Crane} is not always optimal in terms of its
complexity, an automated way to determine the asymptotic complexity of a
solution would be helpful as well. Achieving these goals would make
\textsc{Crane} capable of automatically constructing efficient ways to compute a
function (e.g., a sequence) of interest. In addition to the potential impact to
areas of artificial intelligence (AI) such as statistical relational AI
\citep{DBLP:series/synthesis/2016Raedt}, \textsc{Crane} could be beneficial to
research in combinatorics as well \citep{DBLP:conf/ilp/BarvinekB0ZK21}.
